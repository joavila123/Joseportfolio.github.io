# SQL Filters:
In this project the organization is working to make their system more secure. It is my objective to ensure the system is safe, investigate all potential security issues, and update employee computers as needed. I applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee machines. I used two different tables, login attempts and employees. I used the AND, OR, and NOT operators to filter for the specific information needed for each task. I also used LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns.

## SIEM and cyber threat map:
In this project I used Microsoft Azure and its many features to creat a SIEM. Created virtual machine in the cloud which was the honeypot and made it quite vulnerable to the internet. Also, utilized a powershell script and free IP geolocation API to monitor/log attacks that came from various IP address across the world and displayed it in a threat map. The data displayed how many times an attack came from a specific IP address along with the country of origin from which the attack came from.

### CISCO Packet Tracer Simple Network & Firewalls

CISCO Packet Tracer was used for this project to construct a virtual simple network. A server was set and connected to a switch along with other computers. The firewalls of the server were specified to only allow certain ports to connect and deny other ports.
